The company operates hot air balloons in Staffordshire, Derbyshire, Cheshire, Warwickshire, Worcestershire & Shropshire. Each balloon is flown by one pilot, who is assisted by two Ground Crew (this position). The ground crew assist the pilot in driving the equipment from base to launch site, setting up the balloon, helping in the launch, pursuit of the balloon once airborne (it travels with the wind), maintaining radio contact, and then retrieving the balloon, passengers and pilot when it lands. Everything is then returned to base for preparation for the next flight. Duty periods will vary in length by venue, but are anything from 3hrs to 8hrs typically.", "The successful applicant will need to be highly reliable, an experienced driver, have a safety conscious attitude, enjoy working outside, have good communication skills, plenty of common sense and a hands-on approach to resolving problems. Furthermore, it should be noted that the work is often at unsociable hours: the balloons may fly at 6am in the summer, and can also be flying at 9pm when the evenings are light enough.", "One of the most important qualities for our ground crew to possess, is availability. Due to the vagaries of the weather, we often don't know whether we are flying from one day to the next. Consequently, WHEN the weather suddenly becomes suitable for flying, we MUST be able to summon enough ground crew to operate. The more available you are, the more work we can offer you. You will need to be highly available until at least October, on both weekdays and weekends.", "In order for our business to function correctly, we retain pool of ground crew so that we can be confident of always obtaining enough crew on any given day. Some of our crew are more flexible than others, and so they get more of the work. There exists the opportunity to earn \u00a35000 per year for the most available and diligent crew. There is no pressure for you to be available on any particular days, but obviously, if you are never available, you will not get the work.", "In addition to all of the above, our crew thoroughly enjoy the nature of the work, and it is the excitement and variety which is the main attraction, over and above the opportunity to earn extra income. Many of our crew have been with us for more than 15 years. We have some great fun working with the balloons and looking after the passengers (who can also be excited and nervous in equal measure). You will meet a new circle of friends, and do something that is very different to any other work you do or have done.", "Do not apply for this position if you need to earn a fixed amount per month. It doesn't work like that. Some weeks we might not fly at all because of the weather, and other weeks we might fly twice each day, every day! You are only paid when working, and you only work as much as you want to. The pay rate is fixed per session, but works out at about \u00a310 per hour. We usually provide breakfast after early morning sessions.", "So, if the above appeals to you, and you would like to get involved in something completely different, get in touch.
